Great! Um... How do we do anything with this?
---------------------------------------------

To compute tax:

- Need: Brackets, Earnings, Filing Status
- Steps: 

    1.  Split earnings into brackets
    2.  Compute tax for each bracket
    3.  Sum


split_by_bracket
----------------

a.  start w/ lowest bracket
b.  if earnings < bracket  
        ->  tax is earnings * tax rate

c.  else tax is 
        tax for this bracket 
        + tax on remaining earnings
