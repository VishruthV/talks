Party Like it's 500BC
=====================

This talk from the September 2014 meeting of PyAtl examined the thought
process developers use to solve problems, including

    - decomposition of a problem specification
    - considering tradeoffs among design choices
    - iterative refinement to build a solution

We also looked at the specific details of implementing a solution in
Python.

doctest
=======

The slides include a full ``doctest`` suite. To run it, download the
`source for the slides`_, then run::

    python -m doctest -v 500BC.rst

Try playing around with the source: start by breaking something to see
the tests fail, then tackle the challenge problem!
